\paragraph{Alternative definition from Alison -- to think about}
Summarising, we propose the following probabilistic definition, which
revolves around our definitions in Section \ref{attributes}.  Let a
potentially serendipitous event $\langle T,B,R \rangle$ lie at a given point in
serendipity space $\langle a, (b,c), d \rangle$, where:

1. $a$ represents the chance dimension; the probability that a trigger
may arise, where $0 < a \leq 1$.

2. $(b, c)$ represent the sagacity dimension; where $b$ is the probability
that , $0 < b \leq 1$ that the system will classify the trigger as
interesting and subject it to further processing; and given that the
trigger has been marked as interesting, $c$ is the probability that
trigger T will be transformed into result $R$.

3. $d$ represents the value dimension, where the value of $R$ is $d$, and
$\epsilon < d \leq 1$.

If these conditions are met, then the system has generated a
potentially serendipitous event which lies at a specific point in
serendipity space. If $a * b * c < \delta$, then $1 - a * b * c$ is the
system's serendipity potential. Otherwise, the system does not have
serendipity potential.
