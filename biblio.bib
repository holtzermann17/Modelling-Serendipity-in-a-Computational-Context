This is left unsaid by Ritchie except for a small section in p. 93 Q. reliance on inspiring set - does this mean that Ritchie's criteria are heavily influenced by a case-based reasoning type approach? e.g. criteria 9 checks that the examples in the inspiring set can be replicated - what if this isn't important in your system (for example... ***) or if there is no inspiring set? (*** check feedback from ICCCX paper as I think this is discussed there ***) Q. In fact is the whole approach too closely fitted to a computational approach such as used by Ritchie in JAPE or STANDUP, at the expense of applying more generally to a variety of approaches? For debate about computer creativity: Dreyfus 1979, Lovelace, Weizenbaum 1976 Computer power and human reason It is outside the scope of this paper to build a model of creativity or of the creative process, or to define what is neeeded to show evidence of creativity (p. 68). The aim is to formally define observable factors which possibly relate to creativity.},

abstract={Creativity cannot exist in a vacuum; it develops through feedback, learning, reflection and social interaction with others. However, this perspective has been relatively under-investigated in computational creativity research, which typically examines systems that operate individually. We develop a thought experiment showing how structured dialogues can help develop the creative aspects of computer poetry. Centrally in this approach, we ask questions of a poem, inviting it to tell us in what way it may be considered a {``}creative making.{''}},

 abstract = {Two distinguished medical scientists independently observed the same phenomenon in the course of their research: reversible collapse of rabbits' ears after injection of the enzyme papain. One went on to make a discovery based on this serendipitous or chance occurrence; the other did not. Intensive tandem interviews were conducted with each of these scientist in order to discover similarities and differences in their experiences with the floppy-eared rabbits. These interview materials are analyzed for the light they shed on the process of scientific discovery in general and on the serendipity pattern in particular.},

bookTitle="Artificial Intelligence and Creativity: An
Interdisciplinary Approach",
year="1994",
publisher="Springer Netherlands",

pages="335--342",
abstract="The paper is concerned with creativity and computation in
two different respects. Firstly, there is the major issue of
understanding the creative process and, secondly, there is the issue
of supporting or amplifying that process. The relationship between
these two concerns is less clear than might be supposed and it has
been interesting to notice, at a number of recent meetings, that
researchers can largely be divided into those considering one or other
of those issues in isolation. It is not clear whether or not those
concerned with a computational understanding of creativity believe
that achieving it might bring direct benefits, such as the
amplification of creative abilities, and, equally, it is not clear
that those working on support systems expect to contribute to the
development of computational models. In any case, the thesis of this
paper is that, with appropriate care, research into each issue can
benefit work on the other.",

title={Vector-based navigation using grid-like representations in artificial agents},
journal={Nature},
year={2018},
abstract={Deep neural networks have achieved impressive successes in fields ranging from object recognition to complex games such as Go1,2. Navigation, however, remains a substantial challenge for artificial agents, with deep neural networks trained by reinforcement learning3-5 failing to rival the proficiency of mammalian spatial behaviour, which is underpinned by grid cells in the entorhinal cortex                6              . Grid cells are thought to provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for coding space7,8 and is critical for integrating self-motion (path integration)6,7,9 and planning direct trajectories to goals (vector-based navigation)7,10,11. Here we set out to leverage the computational functions of grid cells to develop a deep reinforcement learning agent with mammal-like navigational abilities. We first trained a recurrent network to perform path integration, leading to the emergence of representations resembling grid cells, as well as other entorhinal cell types                12              . We then showed that this representation provided an effective basis for an agent to locate goals in challenging, unfamiliar, and changeable environments--optimizing the primary objective of navigation through deep reinforcement learning. The performance of agents endowed with grid-like representations surpassed that of an expert human and comparison agents, with the metric quantities necessary for vector-based navigation derived from grid-like units within the network. Furthermore, grid-like representations enabled agents to conduct shortcut behaviours reminiscent of those performed by mammals. Our findings show that emergent grid-like representations furnish agents with a Euclidean spatial metric and associated vector operations, providing a foundation for proficient navigation. As such, our results support neuroscientific theories that see grid cells as critical for vector-based navigation7,10,11, demonstrating that the latter can be combined with path-based strategies to support navigation in challenging environments.},

In this task an important challenge is information fusion of diverse mainly unstructured representations into a unique knowledge format. This chapter focuses on merging information available in text documents into an information network -- a graph representation of knowledge. The problem addressed is how to efficiently and effectively produce an information network from large text corpora from at least two diverse, seemingly unrelated, domains. The goal is to produce a network that has the highest potential for providing yet unexplored cross domain links which could lead to new scientific discoveries. The focus of this work is better identification of important domain bridging concepts that are promoted as core nodes around which the rest of the network is formed. The evaluation is performed by repeating a discovery made on medical articles in the migraine magnesium domain.",

abstract="Knowledge Graphs (KG) represent a large amount of Semantic Associations (SAs), i.e., chains of relations that may reveal interesting and unknown connections between different types of entities. Applications for the contextual exploration of KGs help users explore information extracted from a KG, including SAs, while they are reading an input text. Because of the large number of SAs that can be extracted from a text, a first challenge in these applications is to effectively determine which SAs are most interesting to the users, defining a suitable ranking function over SAs. However, since different users may have different interests, an additional challenge is to personalize this ranking function to match individual users' preferences. In this paper we introduce a novel active learning to rank model to let a user rate small samples of SAs, which are used to iteratively learn a personalized ranking function. Experiments conducted with two data sets show that the approach is able to improve the quality of the ranking function with a limited number of user interactions.",

abstract={Recent years have seen the emergence of an important new fundamental theory of brain function. This theory brings information-theoretic, Bayesian, neuroscientific, and machine learning approaches into a single framework whose overarching principle is the minimization of surprise (or, equivalently, the maximization of expectation). The most comprehensive such treatment is the "free-energy minimization" formulation due to Karl Friston (see e.g., Friston and Stephan, 2007; Friston, 2010a,b - see also Fiorillo, 2010; Thornton, 2010). A recurrent puzzle raised by critics of these models is that biological systems do not seem to avoid surprises. We do not simply seek a dark, unchanging chamber, and stay there. This is the "Dark-Room Problem." Here, we describe the problem and further unpack the issues to which it speaks. Using the same format as the prolog of Eddington's Space, Time, and Gravitation (Eddington, 1920) we present our discussion as a conversation between: an information theorist (Thornton), a physicist (Friston), and a philosopher (Clark).},

ABSTRACT={The emerging neurocomputational vision of humans as embodied, ecologically embedded, social agents – who shape and are shaped by their environment – offers a golden opportunity to revisit and revise ideas about the physical and information-theoretic underpinnings of life, mind, and consciousness itself. In particular, the active inference framework (AIF) makes it possible to bridge connections from computational neuroscience and robotics/AI to ecological psychology and phenomenology, revealing common underpinnings and overcoming key limitations. AIF opposes the mechanistic to the reductive, while staying fully grounded in a naturalistic and information theoretic foundation, using the principle of free energy minimization. The latter provides a theoretical basis for a unified treatment of particles, organisms, and interactive machines, spanning from the inorganic to organic, non-life to life, and natural to artificial agents. We provide a brief introduction to AIF, then explore its implications for evolutionary theory, ecological psychology, embodied phenomenology, and robotics/AI research. We conclude the paper by considering implications for machine consciousness.}

abstract="In this paper, we argue for a theoretical separation of the free-energy principle from Helmholtzian accounts of the predictive brain. The free-energy principle is a theoretical framework capturing the imperative for biological self-organization in information-theoretic terms. The free-energy principle has typically been connected with a Bayesian theory of predictive coding, and the latter is often taken to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception as unconscious inference. If our interpretation is right, however, a Helmholtzian view of perception is incompatible with Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle. We argue that the free energy principle and the ecological and enactive approach to mind and life make for a much happier marriage of ideas. We make our argument based on three points. First we argue that the free energy principle applies to the whole animal--environment system, and not only to the brain. Second, we show that active inference, as understood by the free-energy principle, is incompatible with unconscious inference understood as analagous to scientific hypothesis-testing, the main tenet of a Helmholtzian view of perception. Third, we argue that the notion of inference at work in Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle is too weak to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception. Taken together these points imply that the free energy principle is best understood in ecological and enactive terms set out in this paper.",

abstract="In this chapter we will examine in more detail the concept of an artificial intelligence that can improve upon itself, and show how that might not be as problematic as some researchers think. The ability for an AI to better itself over time through a process called recursive self-improvement has been considered as a promising path to creating the technological singularity. In this type of system an AI has access to its own source code and possibly even hardware, with the ability to edit both at will. This gives the AI the option to constantly improve upon itself and become increasingly intelligent. Eventually this would produce versions of the AI that are more intelligent than humans and cause us to reach the technological singularity. Researchers have speculated that this process could create an extremely dangerous situation for humanity as we get left behind in a growing intelligence gap. This chapter proposes that this gap would not be as drastic as initially thought, and that there may be natural limits on the ability for an AI to improve upon itself. Along the way we will propose that the law of diminishing returns will take effect to limit runaway intelligence. We also theorize that developing and manufacturing new hardware will introduce a latency in AI improvement that could easily be exploited to halt any dangerous situation.",

Research on problem solving has usually focused on search of an ``instance space'' (empirical exploration) and a ``hypothesis space'' (generation of theories). In scientific discovery, search must often extend to other spaces as well: spaces of possible problems, of new or improved scientific instruments, of new problem representations, of new concepts, and others. This paper focuses especially on the processes for finding new problem representations and new concepts, which are relatively new domains for research on discovery.",

title="The feeling of grip: novelty, error dynamics, and the predictive brain",
journal="Synthese",

abstract="According to the free energy principle biological agents resist a tendency to disorder in their interactions with a dynamically changing environment by keeping themselves in sensory and physiological states that are expected given their embodiment and the niche they inhabit (Friston in Nat Rev Neurosci 11(2):127--138, 2010. doi:10.1038/nrn2787). Why would a biological agent that aims at minimising uncertainty in its encounters with the world ever be motivated to seek out novelty? Novelty for such an agent would arrive in the form of sensory and physiological states that are unexpected. Such an agent ought therefore to avoid novel and surprising interactions with the world one might think. Yet humans and many other animals find play and other forms of novelty-seeking and exploration hugely rewarding. How can this be understood in frameworks for studying the mind that emphasise prediction error minimisation? This problem has been taken up in recent research concerned with epistemic action---actions an agent engages in to reduce uncertainty. However that work leaves two questions unanswered, which it is the aim of our paper to address. First, no account has been given yet of why it should feel good to the agent to engage the world playfully and with curiosity. Second an appeal is made to precision-estimation to explain epistemic action, yet it remains unclear how precision-weighting works in action more generally, or active inference. We argue that an answer to both questions may lie in the bodily states of an agent that track the rate at which free energy is being reduced. The recent literature on the predictive brain has connected the valence of emotional experiences to the rate of change in the reduction of prediction error (Joffily and Coricelli in PLoS Comput Biol 9(6):e1003094, 2013. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003094; Van de Cruys, in Metzinger and Wiese (eds) Philosophy and predictive processing, vol 24, MIND Group, Frankfurt am Main, 2017. doi:10.15502/9783958573253). In this literature valenced emotional experiences are hypothesised to be identical with changes in the rate at which prediction error is reduced. Experiences are negatively valenced when overall prediction error increases and are positively valenced when the sum of prediction errors decrease. We offer an ecological-enactive interpretation of the concept of valence and its connection to rate of change of prediction error. We show how rate of change should be understood in terms of embodied states of affordance-related action readiness. We then go on to apply this ecological-enactive account of error dynamics to provide an answer to the first question we have raised: It may explain why it should feel good to an agent to be curious and playful. Our ecological-enactive account also allows us to show how error dynamics may provide an answer to the second question we have raised regarding how precision-weighting works in active inference. An agent that is sensitive to rates of error reduction can tune precision on the fly. We show how this ability to tune precision on the go can allow agents to develop skills for adapting better and better to the unexpected, and search out opportunities for resolving uncertainty and progressing in its learning.",

One useful way to approach this important but elusive question may be to consider language itself as a cognition-enhancing animal-built structure. To take this perspective is to view language as a kind of self-constructed cognitive niche. These self-constructed cognitive niches play, I suggest, three distinct but deeply interlocking roles in human thought and reason. Working together, these three interlocking routines radically transform the human mind, and mark a genuine discontinuity in the space of animal minds.}

abstract="Recent work in cognitive and computational neuroscience depicts the human cortex as a multi-level prediction engine. This `predictive processing' framework shows great promise as a means of both understanding and integrating the core information processing strategies underlying perception, reasoning, and action. But how, if at all, do emotions and sub-cortical contributions fit into this emerging picture? The fit, we shall argue, is both profound and potentially transformative. In the picture we develop, online cognitive function cannot be assigned to either the cortical or the sub-cortical component, but instead emerges from their tight co-ordination. This tight co-ordination involves processes of continuous reciprocal causation that weave together bodily information and `top-down' predictions, generating a unified sense of what's out there and why it matters. The upshot is a more truly `embodied' vision of the predictive brain in action.",

Recently it has been proposed that the causal models used in human predictive processing are best formally modeled by categorical probability distributions. Crucially, such distributions assume a well-defined, discrete state space. In this paper we explore the consequences of this formalization. In particular we argue that the level of detail of generative models and predictions modulates prediction error. We show that both increasing the level of detail of the generative models and decreasing the level of detail of the predictions can be suitable mechanisms for lowering prediction errors. Both increase precision, yet come at the price of lowering the amount of information that can be gained by correct predictions. Our theoretical result establishes a key open empirical question to address: How does the brain optimize the trade-off between high precision and information gain when making its predictions?"

abstract="This paper presents a novel proof-theoretic account of dialogue coherence. It focuses on an abstract class of cooperative information-oriented dialogues and describes how their structure can be accounted for in terms of a multi-agent hybrid inference system that combines natural deduction with information transfer and observation. We show how certain dialogue structures arise out of the interplay between the inferential roles of logical connectives (i.e., sentence semantics), a rule for transferring information between agents, and a rule for information flow between agents and their environment. The order of explanation is opposite in direction to that adopted in game-theoretic semantics, where sentence semantics (or a notion of valid inference) is derived from winning dialogue strategies. That approach and the current one may, however, be reconcilable, since we focus on cooperative dialogue, whereas the game-theoretic tradition concentrates on adversarial dialogue.",

Mel Rhodes’s classic "4Ps" of creativity, the "Person, Process, Product, and Press," offer an initial typology. Here, Rhodes’s ideas are connected with Elinor Ostrom’s work on the analysis of economic governance to generate several "creativity design principles." These principles frame a survey of the shared concepts that structure the contexts that support creative work. The concepts are connected to the idea of computational "tests" to foreground the relationship with standard computing practice, and to draw out specific recommendations for the further development of computational creativity culture.}

abstract="Discourse semantics based on dependent type theory, such as Ranta's Type Theoretical Grammar, is expected to serve as a proof-theoretic alternative to standard, model-theoretic discourse semantics such as DRT and DPL. Its compositionality, however, with respect to anaphora and presupposition, has been left as an open problem, toward which several different approaches have been proposed. In this paper, I will point out that four problems still remain to be solved in the previous approaches, and present a compositional discourse theory that remedies this enterprise, by the combination of the following settings: 1) the context-passing mechanism, 2) @-operators for representing anaphora/presupposition triggers, 3) (bottom-up) semantic composition with raw terms, and 4) (top-down) anaphora resolution as type checking.",
