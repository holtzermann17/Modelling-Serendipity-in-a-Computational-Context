\section{A model of serendipity potential} \label{sec:our-model}

%\subsection{Definitions of the model's phases and links between them} \label{sec:modelTerms}

We now present short definitions of each of the six phases identified
in the previous section, along with links between them.  As mentioned
earlier, our thinking is informed by the predictive processing
framework, advocated in recent work of \citet{clark2013whatever},
building on the work of \citet{friston2009free} and others.  A central
idea in such theories is that perceived events are only passed forward
to higher cognitive layers if they do not conform with our prior
expectations.  A response to prediction error can either motivate
action, which ameliorates the error by bringing the world into
alignment with our predictions, or else motivate adaptation of the
predictive models.

%% Artifacts. Springer, Berlin, Germany.

This perspective highlights the fact that, going beyond Pasteur's
famous idiom, chance not only \emph{favours}, but also \emph{shapes}
the prepared mind.  For example, ``neural networks learn to associate
(combine) patterns without being explicitly programmed in respect of
those patterns'' \cite[p.~137]{boden}.  Whereas predictive processing
accounts are ``currently computationally fleshed out predominantly at
the basic perception and motor control level'' \cite{KWISTHOUT201784},
here, we will consider a range of higher cognitive functions.  Current
research in cognitive science observes that the functional
architecture of the human brain ``allow[s] the confluence of
information related to perception, cognition, emotion, motivation, and
action'' \cite[p.~357]{Pessoa2017}.  Our model is, similarly, an
abstraction of a functional architecture.



%% We will have to deal with the topic raised by the AIJ editor
%% -- Are there different places to begin in the model?  Do
%% we always start with perception?

The six phases in our model exhibit clear logical dependencies.%% , which
%% we will illustrate using notation from constructive type theory---a
%% notational strategy inspired by work in computational semantics
%% \cite{Chatzikyriakidis2018}.  In particular, it has been applied to
%% model linguistic phenomena of anaphora and presupposition
%% \cite{10.1007/978-3-662-43742-1_2,krahmer1999presupposition,piwek2000presuppositions}.
We assume that earlier steps can be returned to from later ones, and
also that anticipation of later steps plays a role in the way the
process runs.  Anticipation is widely recognised to play a role in
pseudoserendipitous discovery: for example, improved ways to process
rubber and safe antibiotics were pursued in broad outline long before
the specific details became clear \cite{fleming,goodyear1855gum}.
Similarly, Pasteur's research has been retroactively described as
``use-inspired'' \cite{stokes1997pasteur}.  Anticipation plays an
subtle role in serendipity: the unexpected event does not emerge
relative to a blank slate, but to existing top-down predictions,
including our anticipation of ourselves, our customs, and our
\emph{Umwelt} \cite{dennett_2013}.

The model remains relatively open interpretation, which we regard as a
strength.  For example, some of the key stages involve synthesis,
e.g., of a new hypothesis, a new method, or a new application, and we
do not say here how such syntheses would be implemented.  This allows
anyone interested in exploring the model in practical settings the
opportunity to make an argument for
or against the presence of the phases and transitions between them
within their system.  In Section \ref{sec:system-analysis}, we will
give examples of historical systems that match the outlines of the
model, and we comment briefly on the prospects of more creating robust
demonstration systems using contemporary technologies in Section
\ref{sec:discussion}.

%% In the rest of the section we will take the following story as a running example.

%% \begin{quote}
%% % Some 40 years ago 
%% ``\emph{Symcha Blass, an Israeli engineer, observed that a large tree near a leaking faucet exhibited a more vigorous growth than the other trees in the area, which were not reached by the water from the faucet.  Blass knew that conventional methods of irrigation waste much of the water that is applied to the crop, and so the example of the leaking faucet led him to the concept of an irrigation system that would apply water in small amounts, literally drop by drop. Eventually he devised and patented a low-pressure system for delivering small amounts of water to the roots of plants at frequent intervals.}'' \cite{shoji1977drip}

%% In this respect we note that Friston's model of predictive processing
%% makes more specific and detailed assumptions about structure and
%% interconnection than we will adhere to here, namely that ``error-units
%% receive messages from the states in the same level and the level
%% above; whereas state-units are driven by error-units in the same level
%% and the level below'' \cite[p.~297]{friston2009free}.  In simpler
%% biologically-inspired terms, ``the brain generates top-down
%% predictions that are matched bottom-up with sensory information''
%% \cite[p.~2]{Bruineberg2018}.  The mismatch between sense data and
%% existing ubiquitously generative models is how prediction errors are
%% said to arise, which the system then strives to correct.  Our model
%% also has integral generative aspects, but they differ at the different
%% phases.

\noindent Links between phases can be described with the logic of
predictive processing: errors are propagated bottom-up
($\mathrm{Phase}\ n\rightarrow\mathrm{Phase}\ n+1$) relative to predictions which are made top-down
($\mathrm{Phase}\ n+1\rightarrow\mathrm{Phase}\ n$).

% \subsection{Summary}

Certainly it is possible to speak about serendipity, for example as
accidents plus sagacity, without such an elaborate framework.
However, the model provides guidelines for implementors and analysts
that simpler definitions would not, and more precision about the
phases and their relationships than other recent models.  Illustrative
examples of each of the phases can be readily found in the literature:
\begin{itemize}
\item Spencer Silver discovered a new high-tack, low-peel, adhesive
  that was not at all useful for his original task of gluing
  aeroplanes together \cite{tce-postits}.
\item Comparing different reactions to the same basic observation in
  two different labs, \citet[p.~131]{floppyearedrabbits1958barber}
  note that ``the methods and assumptions on which a systematic
  investigation is built selectively focus the researcher's
  attention.''
%%
\item De Mestral perfomed a focus shift in a literal fashion, when he
  examined burrs under a microscope and noticed how their hooks work
  as a fastener in connection with certain fibres.
%%
 %%
\item Nearly 60 years before Alexander Fleming, Eugene Semmer both
  discovered and also cursorily explained the curious effects of
  \emph{penicillium notatum}---but he failed to grasp the vital
  problem his discovery could have solved
  \cite[p.~75]{cropley2013creativity}.
%%
\item
  Heavier-than-air flight had been imagined long before it was a
  reality, but solving practical problems in aviation depended on
  dramatic contemporaneous progress in human interaction
  \cite[p.~292]{spenser2008airplane} that could not have been planned
  in advance.
%%
\item All of these examples, once all of the steps were eventually in
  place, led to positive evaluations.
\end{itemize}

%% We then defined each component with reference
%% to theoretical literature.  Table \ref{tab:model-summary-table}
%% summarises the model that results from this analysis.
